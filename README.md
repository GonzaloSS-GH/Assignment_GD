## Project for Coursera. Getting and Cleaning Data
The data is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is taken from experiments taken from a group of 30 volunteers (19-48) years.
The dataset was divided into two datasets, 70% of the volunteers were selected for training data and 30% for test data.

### The assignment is to create one R script.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. The end result is shown in the file tidy_dataset.txt.
7. The code book is in the file CodeBook.md.
8. The R script is in the file run_analysis.R
